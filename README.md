# zenva-create-html5-game-from-scratch
A repo for running through the tutorials and examples included as part of the Create an HTML5 Game from Scratch course at https://academy.zenva.com/product/create-a-html5-game-from-scratch/

If you like checking out misc courses at great prices, keep your eyes on the Slashdot Deals website at https://deals.slashdot.org/. I purchased this course along with about a dozen others in a collection that cost about $7 (too good to pass up, even if it takes me forever to actually find the time to run through them).
